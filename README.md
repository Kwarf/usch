## FAQ

### I get an error stating "cannot find native shaderc library on system; falling back to build from source", what do?

I'm using the [shaderc](https://crates.io/crates/shaderc) crate to compile GLSL shaders into SPIR-V.
This requires the C++ shaderc library, which ships with the [Vulkan SDK](https://www.lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk/).

If you don't want to, or can't build this automatically from source you can install the SDK,
then point to its location in a [config.toml](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html)
file in a location you find appropriate, ex. `%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\config.toml`.
```toml
[env]
VULKAN_SDK = "C:\\VulkanSDK\\1.3.211.0"
```
